## What's next?

- You can see the pictures taken by your time-lapse wearable by attaching your monitor, keyboard and mouse to the Pi Zero and navigating to the folder `/home/pi/time-lapse`. Don't forget that your time-lapse will still be taking pictures, as the program will load when the Pi Zero boots up. Alternatively, you can remove the SD card from your wearable and use it in another Raspberry Pi with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
- If you are using a Pi Zero W, you could [enable the VNC server](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/teachers-guide/remote/) to be able to view the photographs remotely from another computer.
- You could create a [gif using your time-lapse pictures](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/timelapse-setup/)?
- Instead of lights, could you incorporate a sensor or a button into your project to take a photograph only when the sensor is triggered?
- Could you design and 3D-print a case for your wearable? You could make something like [this one by Adafruit](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/wearable-pi-zero-camera/).
